## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request:
1. Check the existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Create a new issue with a clear title and detailed description
3. Include steps to reproduce (for bugs) or use cases (for features)

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your work
2. **Write clear, maintainable code** following the project's coding style
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly before submitting
4. **Document your changes** - update relevant documentation and add code comments where appropriate
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes

### Coding Standards

- Use modern C++20 features where appropriate
- Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions
- Keep the separation between UI (`NetLens.App`) and core logic (`NetLens.Core`)
- Add file headers to new source files crediting the project and license
- Write self-documenting code with comments for complex logic

### File Headers

All new source files should include a standard header:

```cpp
// NetLens - Modern Windows Network Scanner
// Copyright (c) 2025 Olivier Flentge
// Licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).
// See the LICENSE file in the project root for details.
```

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable
